This code is implemented in google colab.


To demonstrate the working of this algorithm we will be working on a video file of a road. You can download the dataset from this GitHub link â€“ Dataset

Road lane detection is crucial for enabling self-driving cars to follow their designated path while avoiding the risk of drifting into other lanes. Lane recognition algorithms analyze visual input to accurately identify the position and boundaries of road lanes. These systems play a vital role in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle technologies.
